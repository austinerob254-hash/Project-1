        # "Do you want to download the SDK?" and license prompts.

        yes | buildozer android debug || true

        # 2. Specifically target the Buildozer-managed SDK manager to accept all licenses.
        # This ensures that even newer versions (like 36.1) are covered.

        # 3. Final build attempt now that licenses are definitely accepted.
